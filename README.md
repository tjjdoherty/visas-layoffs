# visas-layoffs
An investigation into the relationship between U.S. Layoffs and H1B Visa petitions to determine true motive for downsizing.

## Project Scope

This project begins with a hypothesis:

#### The stream of layoffs in the tech industry since 2022 is not about accommodating for AI efficiency gains, it is about the insourcing of temporary workers as a cheaper substitute and correcting overhiring in the pandemic.

To examine this, I have pulled from two data sources:
- The [H-1B Employer Data Hub]("https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-and-studies/h-1b-employer-data-hub"), showing employer petitions for H1B visas from 2017 to October 2025
- [Layoffs.fyi]("https://layoffs.fyi"), where the author Roger Lee (credit) has kept a database of news sources reporting on layoffs since COVID began


## Background
This project was inspired after Salesforce announced layoffs of 4,000 people in September 2025 *"because I need less heads [with AI]"*. What has been less public is that between 2023-25, Salesforce has had 3,683 H-1B visas approved by USCIS (U.S. Citizen & Immigration Services)

You can make the argument that the type of role being hired/laid off is important, but AI is being touted as a threat to virtually all technology company roles, from engineering to customer success. It is being touted in nearly all layoff notices from a wide array of organisations. 

Furthermore, the H-1B visa is a intended for jobs requiring specialised skills that the employer has been unable to find in a US Citizen. All else being equal, it's quite unlikely an ever expanding pool of laid off American tech workers does not possess the skillset for nearly the same number of roles being hired for, in Salesforce's case at least.
